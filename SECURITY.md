# QLBase Security

> [!WARNING]  
> QLBase is a work in progress and QLBase had never been pentested against its possible security vulnerabilities.

Here is an outline of security considerations for QLBase. It aims to raise awareness of potential vulnerabilities and provide best practices for secure development and deployment. Understanding potential threats helps focus security efforts. Consider threats like:

- **Unintended data access**: Unauthorized access to sensitive user data or application logic.
- **Code injection**: Injection of malicious code through input forms or API calls.
- **Denial-of-service attacks**: Overwhelming the system with requests to disrupt service.
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks**: Interception and manipulation of communication between users and QLBase.
- **Supply chain attacks**: Compromised dependencies or libraries.
